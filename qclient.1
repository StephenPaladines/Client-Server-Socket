.SH "REPORTING BUGS"
Currently the bugs in the program are caused by extensive trials
.br
 by the user that contains a combination of empty space or long strings
.br
Another issue in the program is the delay in response by the client to the 
.br
server or vice versa, often truncating the data. To prevent issue simply
.br
redo the comand again without any trivial input.
